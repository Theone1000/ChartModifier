A multi threaded chart rate changer (among other things) written in java, poorly.
>The chart uprating feature was taken from https://github.com/Tripp1n/OsuRateChanger (god bless)

**This program does not support Storyboards and never will. If you happen to modify a chart with storyboards, they will be removed**.

**This program only supports osu!mania and the windows os**

### Chart up/down rating.

Change the speed of any mania chart. Supports mp3, ogg, and wav files.

### Modifying certain aspects of charts.

Change the HP, OD, title, and difficulty of any chart in the program.

### Mass Rate applying

Mass apply rates to highlighted charts by using the "Mass Rate Applier" in the top right corner of the program.

### Auto Chart Loader

When enabled, the program will actively scan your osu!'s title to figure out which chart you are playing, and then add it to the program for rate converting/modifiyng.

Note: This feature typically doesn't work with charts that have a non english author, title, or difficulty.

### Mods

As of right now the only mod is the Quad mod, but more may come.

#### Quads

When enabled, it will place a quad every X note (X = some random integer) in the chart.

### Multi threaded chart processing

If you ever used the OsuRateChanger by Tripp1n, you probably noticed that, when uprating/down rating multiple charts, the program can be slow because it has to process one chart at a time. This program tries to solve that by processing each chart in a new thread.
