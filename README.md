A multi threaded chart rate changer (among other things) written in java, poorly.

**This program does not support Storyboards and never will. If you happen to modify a chart with storyboards, they will be removed**.

**This program only supports mania**

>The chart uprating feature was taken from https://github.com/Tripp1n/OsuRateChanger (god bless)

# Program features

### Chart up/down rating.

Change the speed of any mania chart. Supports mp3, ogg, and wav files.

### Modifying certain aspects of charts.

Change the HP, OD, title, and difficulty of any chart in the program.

### Mass Rate applying

Mass apply rates to highlighted charts by using the "Mass Rate Applier" in the top right corner of the program.

### Multi threaded chart processing

If you ever used the OsuRateChanger by Tripp1n, you probably noticed that, when uprating/down rating multiple charts, the program can be slow because it has to process one chart at a time. This program tries to solve that by processing each chart in a new thread.
